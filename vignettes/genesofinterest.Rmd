### Genes of interest

In Figure 6 of the [pre-print](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.01.429207v3.full), we compiled data from three source ([CellPhoneDB](https://www.cellphonedb.org/), [GWAS catalog](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/) and [Fang et al. 2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-019-0456-1)) to find genes of immunological / pharmacological interest. These genes and their annotations can be accessed internally from within Signac:

```r
library(SignacX)
# See ?Genes_Of_Interest
data("Genes_Of_Interest")
```
